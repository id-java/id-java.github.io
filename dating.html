      <h1>On Dating</h1>
      <p>
        Let me just say right off the bat: I don't have a lot of experience when
        it comes to dating. For many reasons, from early on in my life, I've
        always kind of repressed my feelings (not just romantically, I mean
        almost all my feelings). I remember very vividly the first time I told
        my mom I liked a girl and she liked me too (this was in 7th grade, shout
        out to Eesha btw), and she said “don't look at girls the wrong way. All
        women are goddesses and all men are beasts. Hope youre not a beast” and
        that stuck with me like glue. I kind of felt disgusted at myself for
        liking a girl. I don't want to be a monster. Im not sure what effect
        those words had on me, but ever since im very reluctant when it comes to
        liking a girl. Ive never had any trouble talking to girls, and growing
        up had more female friends than most of my peers, but when it came to
        addressing my feelings for a girl I liked, my brain became so confused.
        I like this girl but am I a monster for wanting to hold her hand? What
        the fuck, how do other guys just do it? Are they monsters? This fucked
        me up for the longest time. The fact that I was raised as an emotional
        sponge for my mother, who always portrayed her feelings and problems as
        vastly more important than mine and basically neglected how I would feel
        about any decisions she made that might affect me meant I struggled
        processing even the simplest of feelings didn't help either. An absent
        father meant I had no one to talk to about these things and so all I did
        was internalize my feelings. Only towards the end of high school I
        started to understand the fucked up manners of my emotional upbringing
        and started to explore the idea that im not a monster for liking a girl.
        <br /><br />
        So toward the end of high school, I thought this girl was cute and asked
        her out and we dated for a few months. We didn't have much in common at
        all, she was all about high school drama and I was all the teachers pet.
        This distinction meant we didn't connect much at an emotional level.
        This coupled with the fact that I spent the summer after graduation
        alone at my apartment (a story for another time) meant that the
        relationship I had with my gf at the time was purely physical. And that
        made me think this is how relationships are, mostly physical, the
        emotional connection comes after. And so when I left for college, the
        relationship lost its meaning and I was left broken because now it meant
        I have no one to share my emotions with.

        <br /><br />
        So I had an epiphany. Maybe relationships are first an emotional
        connection, the physical part comes after. But because I was so fucking
        starved of emotional expression I dove head first into my emotional
        pond. Because I was looking for an emotional connection, it directly
        resulted in me being interested only in girls I vibed with at a much
        deeper level than normal, which wasn't many at all. But it also meant
        that when I did vibe with someone, I fucking nosedived in this new
        feeling of connection.

        <br /><br />
        Luckily, the first girl i connected with didn't reject me (poor girl)
        and we went on a date. I fucked up the date pretty badly and that was
        the end of it. The following summer I spent at home with my freshly
        separated (for the 100th time) mother. The little bit of emotional
        maturity I gained in freshman year made me realize that summer that I
        was very depressed throughout high school. I fucking cried myself to
        sleep most nights because of this realization. But out of this, I
        realized that I needed to draw a line in my relationship with my mother
        (and by extension father, poor guy got the short end of the stick) and
        decided to emotionally disconnect from my family, it wasn't a good
        environment for me. So I spent my sophomore year trying to tackle my
        depression and disconnect from my family. This was a terrible plan to
        execute alone, in hindsight. I had no emotional support and snuck deeper
        into depression. Hello academic probation, goodbye Deans list.

        <br /><br />
        Im realizing im diverging from the initial topic but fuck it we're in it
        now.
        <br /><br />

        Junior year was spent recovering from that. I leaned a little more on my
        parents for emotional support because fuck it I was drowning. Id get
        burned every now and then for seeking support from them and the cost of
        sharing with them how I was really doing was too high for what I got in
        return. Junior year summer I spent recovering from the academic damage
        caused by all this shit in the previous two years. I spent a lot of time
        reflecting on my life and identifying what had gone wrong, when, how,
        and what was damaged internally. I came out a LOT better into my senior
        year.
        <br /><br />

        Oh also, I met this girl in junior year with whom I vibed like no one
        else, ever. Once again I dove head first into the feelings pond, but
        this time I was rejected. But we decided to stay friends because we were
        lab partners and had classes together and frankly I enjoyed her company.
        But I still liked her, and honestly all my friends were asking why don't
        I ask her out, you guys hang out all the time and are practically
        dating, she loves your immature jokes too. So I did again, and was shot
        down again because she said she liked this guy from her co-op from last
        year. Fair enough I thought. But then we continued to flirt and one day
        while studying together she literally asked if she could hold me hand.
        And so I thought alright that was it, this is too confusing and spaced
        myself away from her.

        <br /><br />
        Back to the present day. Lets call her S. S and I went out for dinner
        and at the restaurant took 40 minutes to order food because we were
        vibing so hard that we weren't interested in the food anymore. Then we
        spend hours walking around town talking about life, this is the shit I
        love. I wasn't interested in her at first, honestly I didn't even know
        it was a date (you know about this). But we had a play date the
        following weekend and a couple more the following weekend.<br /><br />

        This is how I decided to approach dating this time: I have had purely
        physical relationships and those aren't fulfilling. Ive tried to connect
        purely emotionally first, and that has worked out to be very confusing.
        This time, im going to find a middle ground and that should work right?
        Nope. Maybe it's just my misfortune, but this is turning out to be
        energetically taxing. I wish I had learned all this in high school so I
        wouldn't be spending as much time and energy into this in my 20s.
        whatever, fuck it.

        <br /><br />
        So all in all my experience with dating has been very confusing and I
        wish I wasn't so emotionally messed up growing up.
